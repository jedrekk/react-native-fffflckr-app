# react-native-fffflckr-app

This is a [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) implementation of the idea behind my [fffflckr](http://fffflckr.com) website. Currently it is a work in progress and if you manage to clone it, build it and it works for you, super rad, but let's not kid ourselves, it's all over the place.

To get it up and running, clone the source, ``npm i`` to install dependencies, open up ``ios/FirstProject.xcodeproj`` in Xcode and run!

Currently targeting 8.2, but there's really no reason for it to need even that.
